## Do you prefer Simulator racing games or casual, and why?

I prefer simulator racing games because I find them a lot more replayable, and I enjoy at least somewhat realistic physics. Not saying casual racing games are bad. I don’t mind playing them when I want to relax, depending on the mood.

## What does simulator games do better than casual?

Obvious answer is physics. All sims are based on circuit racing, rarely are they ever about street racing. Therefore, simulator games are a great way for motorsport fans to drive their favorite racing cars on their favorite circuits while immersing themselves. They can even participate in circuit races online, with friends or even strangers.

This is helped by the fact that almost all simulator racing games have a huge community built around them. No casual racing game can do that. Lastly, simulator racing games can also be a stepping stone to achieve some people’s dream of becoming a real racing driver themselves.

## What does casual games do better than simulator?

Making the most out of a simulator racing game requires some niche pieces of gear—some very expensive. But most people don’t bother with all that. So when you are just hanging out with a bunch of friends or just chilling by yourself, you can fire up any casual racing game and play it, even while lying on your bed.

I also think anyone can enjoy playing a casual round of _Forza_ or _NFS_ even if they aren’t particularly into cars or motorsport.

One more thing casual games have over sims is the freedom of creativity the developers have with casual games. They are not limited by realistic physics or even realistic graphics. So they can come up with very creative game concepts, which have proved to be very popular among fans. For example: _Burnout_, _Driver SF_, _AutoModellista_, _NFS HP_, etc.

## Do you think companies have switched from making high-end simulator games to casual racing games? And why?

Yes and no. Making a good simulator game is not an easy feat. From laser-scanning racing circuits and building a physics engine to modeling the 3D models, these are just some daunting tasks which are not practically possible for a small indie dev team to do.

Therefore, while I think there are fewer and fewer new entries to the genre, the developers who have always been doing it are, and will still keep, doing it.

## Is this the right switch? Define your answer.

Just because casual games have a bigger audience, I believe it is the right decision for indie developers. If they can bring their creative new ideas to a product people come to love, they can grow and do even bigger projects in the future.

As for big-name “AAA” developers, I don’t think they should switch. They have the resources and talent to make good sims; however, they rarely succeed. This is evident by looking at the active sim racing landscape. But these companies are commercial businesses, so they can’t keep making games at a loss. Burning passion is not enough to keep a company afloat. For that reason, they are inclined to make games with a bigger audience and bigger potential profit. It’s hard to argue with that.

## Ideally, what would you like to see in the racing game industry: more casual or more simulators?

At the end of the day, racing sims have a niche target audience. Ideally, I would like to see more casual games with interesting, creative, and unique concepts which will bring more people to the genre and might even spark their interest in cars and car culture.

Ultimately, building a big and strong community is good for both the industry and also the individual gamers, casual and sim.
