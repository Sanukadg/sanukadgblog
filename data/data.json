Therefore simulator games are a great way for motorsport fans to drive their favorite racing cars in their favorite circuits while immersing themselves. And even participate in circuit races online, with friends or even strangers. Which is helped by the fact that almost all simulator racing games have a huge community built around it. No casual racing game can do that. Lastly, simulator racing games can also be a stepping stone to achieve some people’s dream of becoming a real racing driver themselves."

So when you are just hanging out with a bunch of friends or just chilling by your own, you can fire up any casual racing game and play it, even while laying on your bed. And also I think anyone can enjoy playing a casual round of Forza or NFS even if they aren’t particularly into cars or motorsport."

From laser scanning racing circuits and building a physics engine to modelling the 3D models, are just some daunting tasks which are not practically possible for a small indie dev team to do. Therefore while I think there are less and less new entries to the genre, the devs who have always been doing it, are and will still keep doing it."

Because if they can bring their creative new ideas to a product people come to love, they can grow and do even bigger projects in the future. As for big name “AAA” developers, I don’t think they should switch. They have the resources and talent to make good sims, however they rarely succeed. which is evident by looking at the active sim racing landscape. But these companies are commercial businesses so they can’t keep making games at a loss because burning passion is not enough to keep a company afloat. For that reason they are inclined to make games with bigger audience and bigger potential profit. It’s hard to argue with that."

However, his performance was less than ideal as he couldn’t even make it past qualifying in the first three rounds.
