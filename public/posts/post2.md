#### The D1GP and Youichi Imamura’s Journey

The D1 Professional Drift Championship began in the year 2001. Since then, it has seen huge improvements as famous tuning houses joined the series to back drivers. Youichi Imamura, one such driver, began driving as an entrant for the team “A’PEXi” in the second season of the D1GP in a bright yellow Toyota Altezza.

However, his performance was less than ideal as he couldn’t even make it past qualifying in the first three rounds. This was a sheer contrast to his performance from the previous year, where he managed to secure 2nd place in the championship with as much as one win in hand.

#### The Rise of the A’PEXi FD3S RX-7

The A’PEXi FD3S RX-7 made its debut in the D1GP in 2002, replacing Imamura's underperforming Toyota Altezza.

Immediately, it became a threat in the following rounds, proving how good of a weapon the FD3S was especially in the hands of Imamura. Walking up the brackets, he secured two wins that season with the RX7 (Tsukuba and Nikko).

Somehow, upping that fantastic debut season, Imamura managed to secure two wins again in the following year, 2003, which was enough for him to clinch the D1GP championship.

#### A Showcase of A’PEXi’s Excellence

Most D1GP cars in those days were not only competition cars but also showcases of company products. The beautifully plastered RX7 was no different. It was equipped with various A’PEXi engine, suspension, and exhaust parts, such as:

-   N1 Dampers
-   PowerFC ECU

Not only that, but A’PEXi also partnered with other companies to showcase aero kits and wheels. For example:

-   Vertex Ridge Aero Kit by Vertex
-   57Pro Wheelset by Gram Lights

#### Legacy and Evolution

In the following years, the car underwent minor changes, such as small livery tweaks and wheel updates, yet remained at the top of the grid. It finished 3rd in both the 2004 and 2005 seasons.

After that, Imamura and the A’PEXi RX7 parted ways. For the 2006 season, Imamura joined ORC with Top Secret and drove a new Top Secret-built Fairlady Z.

#### The Recreation in Assetto Corsa

This blog post is about the legendary A’PEXi D1GP RX7 driven by Youichi Imamura. I had the opportunity to design a livery for a Vertex Ridge RX7 in _Assetto Corsa_. In this project, I tried to recreate Imamura’s iconic D1 machine.
